This is **Markdown**

By editing this file in GitHub, I am **directly modifying** the repository and making a commit. Why is this important? Because that commit will only exist in the remote repository, and not in my local copy. This will cause Git to raise an alarm the nect time you try and push code from local to remote.

```java
public static void main( String ... args ){
  System.out.println("We won't do much of this!");
}
